/**
 * Produces quasi-plausible trip information for cars using the Engine
 * class for low level process simulation and a highly biased random
 * walk to pick way-points and speed targets.  <p> The basic idea is
 * that there are two special locations associated with a car. Call
 * them "home" and "work". The simulation proceeds by picking a script
 * to be followed and then elaborates that script with lower level
 * maneuvers to execute the script. All of the maneuvers start at
 * either home or work and end with the car being at one of those
 * locations.
 * <p>
 * The scripts available include:
 * <p>
 * a) commute from home to work or back
 * <p>
 * b) if at home, run an errand that involves driving to one or more
 * locations near the home.
 * <p>
 * A script consists of a sequence of way-points that must be
 * visited. To visit each waypoint, a driving strategy picks
 * maneuvers. The maneuvers available include short-term urban style
 * driving segments and longer highway-style segments. The choice of
 * urban or highway segment is made according to how far away the next
 * end-point is.
 * <p>
 * Each segment starts with a turn to a new bearing according to a
 * distribution that is biased based on where the destination is and
 * what the bearing for the current step was. Urban steps tend to
 * prefer a grid (ish) pattern of driving so the new bearing is either
 * the same as the current bearing or 90 degrees left or right of the
 * current bearing with some noise and some chance of a non-right
 * angle turn. Turns onto a highway segment have no grid bias, but are
 * heavily constrained by the direction to the next waypoint.
 * <p>
 * Urban segments also have more variable and lower speeds. Highway
 * segments have relative consistent high speeds.
